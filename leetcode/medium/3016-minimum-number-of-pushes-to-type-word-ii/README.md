# Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given a string `word` containing lowercase English letters.

Telephone keypads have keys mapped with  **distinct**  collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key `2` is mapped with `["a","b","c"]`, we need to push the key one time to type `"a"`, two times to type `"b"`, and three times to type `"c"`  *.* 

It is allowed to remap the keys numbered `2` to `9` to  **distinct**  collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to  **any**  amount of letters, but each letter  **must**  be mapped to  **exactly**  one key. You need to find the  **minimum**  number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string `word`.

Return  *the  **minimum**  number of pushes needed to type* `word`  *after remapping the keys*.

An example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that `1`, `*`, `#`, and `0` do  **not**  map to any letters.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: word = "abcde"
Output: 5
Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
"a" -> one push on key 2
"b" -> one push on key 3
"c" -> one push on key 4
"d" -> one push on key 5
"e" -> one push on key 6
Total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: word = "xyzxyzxyzxyz"
Output: 12
Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
"x" -> one push on key 2
"y" -> one push on key 3
"z" -> one push on key 4
Total cost is 1  *4 + 1*  4 + 1 * 4 = 12
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.
Note that the key 9 is not mapped to any letter: it is not necessary to map letters to every key, but to map all the letters.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: word = "aabbccddeeffgghhiiiiii"
Output: 24
Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
"a" -> one push on key 2
"b" -> one push on key 3
"c" -> one push on key 4
"d" -> one push on key 5
"e" -> one push on key 6
"f" -> one push on key 7
"g" -> one push on key 8
"h" -> two pushes on key 9
"i" -> one push on key 9
Total cost is 1  *2 + 1*  2 + 1  *2 + 1*  2 + 1  *2 + 1*  2 + 1  *2 + 2*  2 + 6 * 1 = 24.
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= word.length <= 105
- word consists of lowercase English letters.

**Memory:** 48.1 MB (beats 32.08%)

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minimumPushes(String word) {
        int[] frequency = new int[26];
        int n = word.length();
        
        // Cache length and use charAt() to avoid O(N) memory allocation overhead
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            frequency[word.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(frequency);
        
        int totalPushes = 0;
        
        for (int i = 25; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (frequency[i] == 0) break;
            
            // Bitwise right shift (>> 3) is mathematically equivalent to division by 8 
            // but executes slightly faster at the CPU level
            totalPushes += (((25 - i) >> 3) + 1) * frequency[i];
        }
        
        return totalPushes;
    }
}
