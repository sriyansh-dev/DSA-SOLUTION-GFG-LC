# Remove Methods From Project

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are maintaining a project that has `n` methods numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given two integers `n` and `k`, and a 2D integer array `invocations`, where `invocations[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that method `ai` invokes method `bi`.

There is a known bug in method `k`. Method `k`, along with any method invoked by it, either  **directly**  or  **indirectly**, are considered  **suspicious**  and we aim to remove them.

A group of methods can only be removed if no method  **outside**  the group invokes any methods  **within**  it.

Return an array containing all the remaining methods after removing all the  **suspicious**  methods. You may return the answer in  *any order*. If it is not possible to remove  **all**  the suspicious methods,  **none**  should be removed.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  n = 4, k = 1, invocations = [[1,2],[0,1],[3,2]]

 **Output:**  [0,1,2,3]

 **Explanation:** 

Method 2 and method 1 are suspicious, but they are directly invoked by methods 3 and 0, which are not suspicious. We return all elements without removing anything.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  n = 5, k = 0, invocations = [[1,2],[0,2],[0,1],[3,4]]

 **Output:**  [3,4]

 **Explanation:** 

Methods 0, 1, and 2 are suspicious and they are not directly invoked by any other method. We can remove them.

 **Example 3:** 

 **Input:**  n = 3, k = 2, invocations = [[1,2],[0,1],[2,0]]

 **Output:**  []

 **Explanation:** 

All methods are suspicious. We can remove them.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 105
- 0 <= k <= n - 1
- 0 <= invocations.length <= 2 * 105
- invocations[i] == [ai, bi]
- 0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
- ai != bi
- invocations[i] != invocations[j]
