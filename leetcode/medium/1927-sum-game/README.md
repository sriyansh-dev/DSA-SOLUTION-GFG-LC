# Sum Game

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with  **Alice**  **starting first**.

You are given a string `num` of  **even length**  consisting of digits and `'?'` characters. On each turn, a player will do the following if there is still at least one `'?'` in `num`:

- Choose an index i where num[i] == '?'.
- Replace num[i] with any digit between '0' and '9'.

The game ends when there are no more `'?'` characters in `num`.

For Bob to win, the sum of the digits in the first half of `num` must be  **equal**  to the sum of the digits in the second half. For Alice to win, the sums must  **not be equal**.

- For example, if the game ended with num = "243801", then Bob wins because 2+4+3 = 8+0+1. If the game ended with num = "243803", then Alice wins because 2+4+3 != 8+0+3.

Assuming Alice and Bob play  **optimally**, return `true`  *if Alice will win and* `false`  *if Bob will win*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: num = "5023"
Output: false
Explanation: There are no moves to be made.
The sum of the first half is equal to the sum of the second half: 5 + 0 = 2 + 3.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: num = "25??"
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can replace one of the '?'s with '9' and it will be impossible for Bob to make the sums equal.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: num = "?3295???"
Output: false
Explanation: It can be proven that Bob will always win. One possible outcome is:
- Alice replaces the first '?' with '9'. num = "93295???".
- Bob replaces one of the '?' in the right half with '9'. num = "932959??".
- Alice replaces one of the '?' in the right half with '2'. num = "9329592?".
- Bob replaces the last '?' in the right half with '7'. num = "93295927".
Bob wins because 9 + 3 + 2 + 9 = 5 + 9 + 2 + 7.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= num.length <= 105
- num.length is even.
- num consists of only digits and '?'.

            }
        }
        int totalQuestionMarks = leftQuestionMarks + rightQuestionMarks;
        int sumDifference = leftSum - rightSum;
        int questionMarkDifference = rightQuestionMarks - leftQuestionMarks;
      
        return totalQuestionMarks % 2 == 1 || sumDifference != 9 * questionMarkDifference / 2;
    }
}
