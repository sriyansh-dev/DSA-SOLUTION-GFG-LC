# Circle and Rectangle Overlapping

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given a circle represented as `(radius, xCenter, yCenter)` and an axis-aligned rectangle represented as `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, where `(x1, y1)` are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and `(x2, y2)` are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the rectangle.

Return `true` *if the circle and rectangle are overlapped otherwise return* `false`. In other words, check if there is  **any**  point `(xi, yi)` that belongs to the circle and the rectangle at the same time.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: radius = 1, xCenter = 0, yCenter = 0, x1 = 1, y1 = -1, x2 = 3, y2 = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Circle and rectangle share the point (1,0).

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: radius = 1, xCenter = 1, yCenter = 1, x1 = 1, y1 = -3, x2 = 2, y2 = -1
Output: false

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: radius = 1, xCenter = 0, yCenter = 0, x1 = -1, y1 = 0, x2 = 0, y2 = 1
Output: true

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= radius <= 2000
- -104 <= xCenter, yCenter <= 104
- -104 <= x1 < x2 <= 104
- -104 <= y1 < y2 <= 104

class Solution {
    public boolean checkOverlap(
        int radius, int xCenter, int yCenter, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        int a = f(x1, x2, xCenter);
        int b = f(y1, y2, yCenter);
        return a * a + b * b <= radius * radius;
    }

    private int f(int i, int j, int k) {
        if (i <= k && k <= j) {
            return 0;
        }
        return k < i ? i - k : k - j;
    }
}
```
