# Stone Game IV

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a  *move*  consisting of removing  **any**  non-zero  **square number**  of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`, return `true` if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return `false`, assuming both players play optimally.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.
```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 105

```java
class Solution {
  public boolean winnerSquareGame(int n) {
    // dp[i] := the winning result for n = i
    boolean[] dp = new boolean[n + 1];

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
      for (int j = 1; j * j <= i; ++j)
        if (!dp[i - j * j]) { // Removing j^2 stones make the opponent lose.
          dp[i] = true;       // So, we win.
          break;
        }

    return dp[n];
  }
}

```
