# Negative Weight Cycle

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a weighted directed graph containing  **V**  vertices numbered from 0 to V - 1 and a list of  **E**  directed edges  **edges[][]**, determine whether the graph contains a negative weight cycle or not.

Each edge is represented as: [u, v, w], where there is a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v having the given weight w.

 **Note:** A negative-weight cycle is a cycle in a graph whose edges sum to a negative value.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: V = 4, E = 4, edges[][] = [[0, 3, 6], [1, 0, 4], [1, 2, 6], [3, 1, 2]]

Output: false
Explanation: Cycle 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 1 has total weight 6 + 4 + 2 = 12, which is positive, so no negative weight cycle exists.

```

```
Input: V = 4, E = 4, edges[][] = [[1, 0, 4], [3, 1, -2], [1, 2, -6], [2, 3, 5]]

Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 with total weight -3, which is negative, so a negative weight cycle exists.

```

  **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ V ≤ 103
0 ≤ E ≤ 105
0 ≤ u, v < V
-106 ≤ w ≤ 106

    public boolean isNegativeWeightCycle(int V, int[][] edges) {
        long[] dist = new long[V];
        Arrays.fill(dist, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            boolean updated = false;
            for (int[] edge : edges) {
                int u = edge[0];
                int v = edge[1];
                int w = edge[2];

                if (dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + w;
                    updated = true;
                    if (i == V - 1) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
            if (!updated) break;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
